## Usage / Examples

There will be lot of code-examples

You can understand how it works :

```bash
import sqlite3
import logging
from flask import Flask ,session
from secret import key
from connection import create_table
```

There are imports to crate app , db etc. 
<br><br>
*secret* it is created by you file to like this :

```bash
key = "YOUR_KEY"
```

*create_table* it is func. to create table if not exist looks like :

```bash
def create_table():
    connection = sqlite3.connect("database.db")
    with open("schema.sql") as f:
        connection.executescript(f.read())
```

We are connecting to db and opening db by *schema*

I think something you understood

So it is end
